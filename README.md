# AIAssignment-1

This assignment consists of moving a vacuum cleaner (agent), through an environment collecting dirt and when its energy or 
dirt storage space is full, use the algorithm A* to find the closest recharge point or trash can. After recharging or disposing of 
the trash the agent must go back to its last position before deciding to take one of the previous cited actions.

The goal is achieved once the agent verified all positions in the environment.
